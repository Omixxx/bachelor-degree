Code readability plays a critical role in software development, especially in an environment where the complexity of information systems continues to evolve. To address this challenge, emerging solutions seek to automate the process of improving code readability, recognizing its critical importance in ensuring maintainability and scalability of software projects. This experimental study aims to investigate the application of the first-of-its-kind deep learning model in the scientific field to enhance the readability of extended code. To tackle such an important undertaking, we adopted a software repository mining approach, followed by a pipeline of operations used to generate our primary dataset. Next, this dataset was analyzed by our selected deep learning model, which proposed a number of modifications aimed at improving the readability of the code. These modifications were then analyzed, revealing that while they contributed in part to slightly improving the readability of the code, they often altered the behavior of the original software suggesting that, although the practice shows promise, there is still ample room for improvement.
