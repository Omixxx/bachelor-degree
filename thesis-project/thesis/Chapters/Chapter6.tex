\chapter{Conclusion and Future Work}
\label{Chapter6}
As observed during this experimental study, the potential for applying machine learning techniques is undoubtedly high, but the results are still nascent. Indeed, although these techniques could significantly impact the software development industry, it is clear that such an impact may require time to mature. Nevertheless, this experimental thesis has provided a pipeline of operations and a dataset that could be valuable for future studies. Future work will focus on applying the pipeline defined in this study on the next iterations of the model, which will not have the same limitations as the current model. In addition, future work could focus on various aspects, such as applying these techniques to other programming languages and analyzing the behavior of future versions of the model considered in the study. In addition to this, future work could extend this research by using a larger amount of data compared to what we utilized in the analysis phases.
