This is my bachelor degree thesis work, including the laTex project for the document and all the projects that allowed the practical evaluation of the results.
Here is some useful information if you want to use the code:

clarity &rarr; contains the source code for creating the dataset <br>

c-lexer &rarr; contains the script that allows you to convert, for the methods extracted from the clarity tool, some characters into special tokens<br>

c-patcher &rarr; contains a series of scripts to manually and automatically patch the model's predictions, and evaluate their semantic and syntactic correctness. <br>

This work was based on the use of the following [model](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10298369)
and on the use of the following [utility](https://github.com/Omixxx/casy) for automatic conversion from lowercase to camel case <br>
More detailed information can be found by reading the thesis (thesis.pdf)

> It should be noted that the project is a little messy, since during the drafting of the project sudden changes were requested which did not allow for a cleaner organization.
